# Reflection — My Project Learning Journey

Working on the **FuelEU Maritime Compliance Platform** was a meaningful learning experience for me. This project helped me understand how different layers of an application work together, and how to organize code in a clean and maintainable structure.

One of the most important things I learned was the use of **Hexagonal Architecture**. Instead of directly mixing business logic with routes and database code, I understood how keeping the **Core Logic separate** makes the system easier to extend, debug, and maintain. Earlier, I would start coding immediately, but this project taught me to **design first**, then implement.

On the backend, I worked with **Node.js + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Prisma**, which improved my confidence in writing APIs, structuring schemas, and handling data flows. On the frontend, building the UI using **React + TailwindCSS** helped me focus on clean component-based design.

## Role of AI in the Project

I used **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** as **assistants**, not as full solution providers.

They mainly helped with:
- Setting up project structure
- Generating boilerplate code
- Suggesting fixes when I got stuck
- Saving time in repetitive coding tasks

However, I always **reviewed and modified** the code myself.  
This ensured I actually understood the logic and didn’t just depend on AI.

## Challenges and How I Solved Them

Throughout development, I encountered several issues:

| Challenge | What I Learned |
|----------|----------------|
| Database connection issues (especially `DATABASE_URL`) | How to configure environment variables properly |
| API returning incorrect or missing data | How to trace data flow step-by-step |
| Handling error cases in frontend UI | Better state management and validation |
| Pooling logic adjustments | Importance of testing with multiple input scenarios |

These challenges improved my debugging skills and made me more comfortable analyzing problems independently.

## What I Want to Improve Next

If I work on this project again, I would:
- Add **authentication and user roles**
- Write **unit and integration tests**
- Deploy using **Docker + CI/CD**
- Use real world maritime emission datasets
- Enhance data visualization dashboards

## Key Takeaway

This project reinforced a simple but important lesson:

> **AI can support development, but real understanding and decision-making must come from the developer.**

The actual design choices, debugging, validation, and improvements were done by me — and that’s where the real learning happened.
